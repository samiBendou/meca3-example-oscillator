#meca3-example-oscillator

Simulation of a field of material points **linked by identical springs**.

Each point is **linked to all the others**.

The points are initially in a **equilateral triangle** configuration of given side `a` with **no speed**.

You can change the **mass** or **pulsation** of the movement in the code to observe different kind of oscillations.
